## Read human readable averaged scans
The data can be downloaded from the [gitlab of the Real Food Campaign](https://gitlab.com/our-sci/rfc-docs/-/tree/master/2019)

```{r ingest human readable avg scans}
dat <- read.csv("./rfc-docs-master-2019/2019/completeDatasetHumanReadableMeans.csv")
str(dat)
# There are 127 measures in the (reduced!) data set!
# list all variables
colnames(dat)
head(dat[,1:10])
```

```{r counts of per crop}
dat %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarize(counts = n()) %>% arrange(desc(counts))
```


```{r counts of varieties within crops}
dat %>% group_by(Type) %>% summarize(probes_count = n(), variety_counts = n_distinct(Variety), .groups='keep') %>% arrange(desc(variety_counts))
```

```{r completeness of source per variety}
dat %>% group_by(Type, Variety) %>% summarize(source_count = n_distinct(Source), .groups='keep')
```
Only few varieties have all three levels of source ("farm","farm_market", "store")

```{r}
dat %>% filter(Type == "carrot") %>% group_by(Variety, Source) %>% summarise(meanAntiox = mean(Antioxidants))
```

```{r}
dat %>% select(State, Antioxidants, Polyphenols)
```
