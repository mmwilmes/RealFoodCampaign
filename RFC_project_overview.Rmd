# Real Food Campaign - Project Overview

URL: [lab.realfoodcampaign.org](lab.realfoodcampaign.org)

- world-wide initiative of scientists to investigate nutrient content of produce in actual food supply chain (not controlled environment)
- measured compounds: antioxidants and minerals
- focus on data quantity, quality, cost, and utility
- connecting soil and food quality
- lab tests of produce and soil
- open science: all data publicly accessible, but anonymized to protect privacy


## Collaboration/Communication

[Overview of survey]([https://lab.realfoodcampaign.org/rfc-food-soil-survey-2019)\\
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/our-sci/rfc-docs/-/tree/master)


## Main delivery

- predict Polyphenols and Antioxidants of produce in the field (upon measurement with Our Sci reflectometer)

## Lab

- spectroscopy data
  - SIWARE NIR 
  - open source matrix reflectometer (Our Sci), readings in range 365-940nm
- tissue
- juice


## Data

[2019 Survey results](https://gitlab.com/our-sci/rfc-docs/-/tree/master/2019)

- Brix is the sugar content in aqueous solution; one degree Brix is 1 gram of sucrose in 100 grams of solution and represents the strength of the solution as percentage by mass
- How are Polyphenols and Antioxidants measured?
- Is Dry.Mass in relation to some Fresh.Mass?
